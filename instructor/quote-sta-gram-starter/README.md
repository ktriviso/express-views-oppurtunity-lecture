### Technologies used and concepts covered

* Node.js / Express.js

* Persistent data
* Relational database concepts (postgres)
* RDBMS relations (SQL joins)
* Bulma and Font-Awesome for styling

## System Description

The application will allow the user to view quotes, sorted by category. 

## System Requirements

1. The application must be RESTful and follow REST-style standards. [REST on Wikipediaâ€¦](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
1. The application must use EJS to render views. 
1. The system must be able to support mutliple user-types, however, v1 may simulate this feature by allowing all users to execute all functions. 
1. The system must be able to persist data in a RDBMS, such as Postgres.
	1. The data stored must be relational and held in multiple tables, accessed via a SQL join. 
	1. updates to collections must also save the proper data in the appropriate tables.
